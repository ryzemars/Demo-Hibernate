✱ JPA là gì
- is a Jakarta EE API specification that describes the management of relational data in enterprise Java applications.
- JPA is a specification of ORM. On the other hand, it is a set of interfaces.
- JPA acts as a bridge between object-oriented domain models and relational database systems.
- Since 2019: it renamed to Jakarta Persistence. javax.persistence is use for Jakarta EE 8 and below

- JPA provider/vendor: Hibernate, EclipseLink (Oracle TopLink), DataNucleus, iBATIS (MyBatis), OpenJPA...
- In SpringBoot: Hibernate is configured as the default JPA provider
    ⤷ → it's no longer necessary to define the the EntityManagerFactory bean unless we want to customize it.

⦿ EntityManagerFactory:
    - This is a factory class of EntityManager. It creates and manages multiple EntityManager instances.

    - EntityManagerFactory provides instances of EntityManager for connecting to same database.
    - All the instances are configured to use the same setting as defined by the default implementation.
    - Several entity manager factories can be prepared for connecting to different data stores.
    ↳ KL: JPA EntityManager is used to access a database in a particular application.
        ⤷ It is used to manage persistent entity instances, to find entities by their primary key identity, and to query over all entities.


⦿ EntityManager
    - It is an Interface, it manages the persistence operations on objects. It works like factory for Query instance.
    - EntityManager provides API for interacting between application and database.
    - Basic functionalities of EntityManager:
        + Persist: create new Entity in database
        + Merge: update an Entity in database
        + Remove: delete an Entity from database

    - One of the most important aspect of a program is connection with database.
    - Database connection and transaction with database is considered as most expensive transaction.


⦿ Entity
    - Entities are the persistence objects, stores as records in the database.

⦿ EntityTransaction
    - It has one-to-one relationship with EntityManager. For each EntityManager, operations are maintained by EntityTransaction class.

⦿ Persistence
    - This class contain static methods to obtain EntityManagerFactory instance.

⦿ Query
    - This interface is implemented by each JPA vendor to obtain relational objects that meet the criteria.
